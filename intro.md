title: 'XML Travelgate Introduction!'
...

The XML Travelgate's API documentation allows clients to access content
from XML Travelgate's inventory of partners. Currently there are more
than 70 providers sources including switching platforms and hotel
chains, 8 rent a car companies and 2 activity companies connected with
our system. Use this API to query, check for availability and book
fares. It can be accessed by any third-party system such as
tour-operator systems, B2C and B2B web applications or third-party
applications. Scalability is not an issue. Our systems are used to heavy
load and monitored 24x7.

The XML Travelgate Hotel PUSH API allows Channel Managers or Hotel Rate
Distributors (Providers) to distribute rates and availability over a
range of Hotel Booking Channels (Sellers).

The XML Travelgate Hub aims to be a single entry point for integrations
of all types. It works on SOAP via http or https. A user/password is
needed to be able to to access the web service.
